# Current known limitations

## Intended limitations

### No revision tree

Kinto.js doesn't track modification history in a form of a revision tree. Instead, it provides information about what eventually changed since the last time you asked, and only that.

This allows covering most synchronization use cases, while being super-lightweight implementation wise.

You can read more about Kinto features [here](http://kinto.readthedocs.io).

### No automatic confict handling

Kinto.js won't try to outsmart you as a conflict resolver. Instead, it provides very explicit ways to know about conflicts, and [simple helpers to handle them](api.md#resolving-conflicts).

## Transactions & rollback

Ideally, we should wrap the whole synchronization flow related operations within a single transaction. While that's a goal and [part of our roadmap](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js/issues/16), right now this isn't fully implemented.

That means if anything fails during a given step of the sync flow while some records have already been processed locally already in the previous one, the database should turn into an intermediate inconsistent state.

Fortunately, as in theory records don't carry any relations information, usually that's simply matter of calling `#sync()` again once you've addressed the reported issues.

## Concurrency

As all local persistence operations are asynchronous, there might be situations where race conditions may occur.

For example, if you're displaying a form for the user to update a record, and in the meanwhile that record is updated from a ServiceWorker, you might just save an obsolete/conflicting version of the record, overriding the last know valid one by "mistake".

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js/issues/34) and we're in the process of finding a decent situation to handle these smoothly.

## In-memory filtering/ordering

All the collection ordering and filtering is done in-memory; that means Kinto.js first loads a whole collection in memory, then process it, meaning you can easily get high-memory usage and degraded performances on very large datasets.

### Take away →

> *Don't use Kinto.js for very large datasets.*

## Custom schema fields are not indexed yet

For now only a few standard fields are indexed by default in IndexedDB collection schemas, resulting in possible degraded performances when filtering & ordering collections. We'll add [custom indexes capability](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js/issues/66) in a near future, though.

### Take away →

> *Seriously, don't use Kinto.js for very large datasets.*

## Future plans

Here's what's planned for future versions, outside of fixing the known limitations listed above:

- Adding a **client-side crypto layer** to the API in order to bring secure & privacy-safe remote storage of user data;
- Allowing to use **other local storage backend than IndexedDB** (WebSQL, etc.) in the form of alternative drivers/adapters;

These are really higher goals, so feedback and help are [warmly welcome](contributing.md)!
