// The file contains a basic implementation of an in-memory store for Kinto.
// The primary purpose of this adapter is to explain the methods required on
// adapter implementations. This adapter is not suitable for production use,
// unless you specifically do not want any data persistence. Even in that case,
// you should almost definitely use something else since this adapter is
// optimized for legibility, not performance or stability. For instance, this
// adapter has no concurrency controls, so simultaneous asynchronous updates
// will result in the database being in an inconsistent state.
//
// USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

// All storage adapters need to extend from BaseAdapter. In fact, you'll get an
// error at run-time if you forget to extend from BaseAdapter. If you're
// developing in TypeScript (recommended!), it's suggested that you write your
// class without the `extends BaseAdapter`, and just the
// `implements AbstractBaseAdapter`, just until you stub out all the methods
// you need. Alternatively, you can copy/paste the BaseAdapter implementation
// and adjust the methods there.

  implements AbstractBaseAdapter<B> {
  // This object will store our records. Since we primarily retreive records by
  // ID, we'll use that as the key.
  private _records: { [key: string]: B };

  // Each adapter is responsible for persisting a lastModified, to keep track
  // of the last modification time. Thankfully, kinto.js updates this property
  // when necessary, so you don't need to worry about keeping it
  // updated yourself.
  private _lastModified: number | null;

  // Each adapter must support arbitrary metadata. This should be an object
  // with string keys and arbitrary values. It's be fine for those values to be
  // serialized to strings, so don't worry about trying to convert to/from
  // native values.

    [key: string]: any;

  // Your constructor can be anything you want it to be. Use this to specify

  // filters, sorted by the given order.

  // `filters` is an object containing keys that represent the desired keys to
  // filter on, and values representing the values to filter on. The keys can
  // be simple keys, like `"title"`, or dot-notation keys like `"author.name"`.
  // Dot-notation keys represent deep properties to filter. Values can be
  // either a single value, or an array of values. If the value is an Array,
  // a record that matches any element of the array is considered a match for
  // the filter.
  //
  // `order` is a string representing the key to sort by. By default, this
  // method should return results ordered by the `last_modified` property
  // in descending order. If the `order` property is prefixed with `-`, return
  // results in ascending order.
  //
  // Examples:
  //   Find all records with `title` equal to "The Lusty Argonian Maid"
  //   list({
  //     filters: { title: "The Lusty Argonian Maid" }
  //   });
  //

  //   Sort all records by `publishDate`, descending.
